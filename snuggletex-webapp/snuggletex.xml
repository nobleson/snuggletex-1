Tomcat webapp configuration file for Aardvark.

This used to contain JDBC authentication stuff but is now blank.
Add any Tomcat-specific things here that might be required in future.

NOTE: This gets filtered to produce a version suitable for deploying
into a running Tomcat, using the build/webapp as docBase and with
reloadable='true'.
